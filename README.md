December 2022 updated to Three r144 and added a 'player' Snoopy character with a basic chase camera

Relaxing at home on a cold December day and looking out at dull houses and streets, I wanted to see this snowy winter scene.

It's just for fun and xp, no real plan.

- Rigged and Animated a free Snowman character that follows the player around
- Mixamo animated and added a player character Snoopy made by Daz and it's extremely well made and easy to work with
- Made Custom Mobile and W,A,S,D, + Arrow movement controls (PC gamer here and I've never played a game on my phone so just made up something that seems to work)
- Heightmap generated ground
- Random placement of trees
- Random placement of deer and a wolf from old free models (will rebuild and animate eventually)
- Custom trees built from primitives objects randomly placed
- Generic Skybox
- Moon Sprite
- Falling snow (looks nice but probably not as efficient as it could be)
- Left mouse orbital camera

TODOs:
1. Update to latest THREE modulerated
2. work on the deer and wolf and their animations
3. maybe add a fp camera
4. combine listeners and controls into one fps thing
5. Update (or, more likely, remove) touch controls
